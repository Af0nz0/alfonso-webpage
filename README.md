# alfonso-webpage

##Description
This is my first ever webpage portfolio.

Motiviation for this project was to see what i have learned the whole week and implementing it to a project i created from scratch and seeing the end result is really amazing.

I made this Portfolio about me to see what i can acomplish with my skills i have learned.

It solves a problem for me i can sumbut this with my resume to my future employer for they can see my skills (not this one specifically)

I actually learned many things that i can use now and can improve with my future projects

This project stands out because i am going to compare this project to my project i will do at the end of the course to see how my skills have improved.
